InstaCash Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/InstaCash-Project/InstaCash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/InstaCash-Project/InstaCash) [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/InstaCash-Project%2FInstaCash.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/InstaCash-Project%2FInstaCash)

InstaCash is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget proposals. The goal of InstaCash is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
- Anonymized transactions using the Zerocoin Protocol.
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.

### Coin Specs
<table>
<tr><td>Algo</td><td>Quark</td></tr>
<tr><td>Block Time</td><td>30 Seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Difficulty Retargeting</td><td>Every Block</td></tr>
<tr><td>Max Coin Supply (PoW Phase)</td><td>2,400,000 ICH</td></tr>
<tr><td>Max Coin Supply (PoS Phase)</td><td>Infinite</td></tr>
<tr><td>Premine</td><td>500,000 ICH*</td></tr>
</table>

*will be burned in future blocks.

### Reward Distribution


### POW REWARD STRUCTURE:

<table>
<th>Block Height</th><th>Masternodes</th><th>Miner</th>
<tr><td>1 – 10000</td><td>N/A</td><td>100 ICH</td></tr>
<tr><td>10001 – 100000</td><td>25% (2.5 ICH)</td><td>75% (7.5 ICH)</td></tr>
</table>

Total ICH in circulation in POW: 1,000,000 [phase-1] + 900,000 [phase-2] + 500,000 [premine] = 2,400,000 ICH

N.B.: First 10k PoW blocks have 100 ICH reward because many people are well informed about the launch because of per-announcement, so we’ll see big hashrate and high mining difficulty in first few days. so we have increased block rewards for first 3~4 days so that no one get any loss from high difficulty mining. Also it’ll sustain coin value.

 

### POS REWARD STRUCTURE: 
<table>
 <th>Block Height</th><th>Block Reward</th><th>Masternodes</th><th>Stakers</th>
<tr><td>100,001 – Inf</td><td>5</td><td>75%</td><td>25%</td></tr>
</table>
